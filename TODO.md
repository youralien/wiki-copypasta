##Assignment: Constructing a Wiki
You must construct a wikipedia-like clone using your chosen framework. You should program the app using the conventions, styles, and functionality of your chosen framework, show off what it can do. It should have the following functionality:
- Topic pages with title and content
- A list of all available pages
- Allow users to submit new pages on topics
- Allow users to edit existing pages 
- Documentation for each major component (Minimum of few sentences at top of every file)
- Not look terrible
- One other feature you'd like to implement (anything from a random page button to images or html within content, or even a search bar. It's up to you to be creative!)
